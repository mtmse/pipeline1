/**
 * This is what SpeechGen2 knows about a TTS. 
 * 
 * The TTS has two different states, between which only one transition 
 * exists. The states are "loading" and "fetching", with respect to 
 * sync points/audio.
 * 
 * The methods addSyncPoint(args) and addAnnouncements(args) can be called 
 * several times until the method getNext() is called for the first time.
 * getNext() initializes the actual speech generation and after that no more
 * jobs are allowed to be added the the TTS.
 * 
 * (This is done to give the (possibly several) underlying worker threads
 * the chance to know when they are done)
 * 
 * TODO:
 * Instead, this could be done using some kind of poison:
 * 	When the client (the transformer class) is ready to fetch the audio it
 * 	could add a "poison synchpoint" to the queue. That poison is duplicated
 * 	so that all tts-threads gets one, and then they die.

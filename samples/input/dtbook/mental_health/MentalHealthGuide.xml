</byline><bridgehead>YOU ARE NOT ALONE
</bridgehead><p>Are you in a state of crisis because you or someone close to you may be mentally ill?  You don’t know what to do or where to go for help.  You are not alone; we have been there and know how helpless you may feel.</p>
<p>This guide is for you.  We hope to help you understand that mental illness is a brain disorder that it is treatable and there is hope. There is nothing to be ashamed of if you or a love one is suffering.  Getting into the system can be hard, keep asking questions, don’t give up seeking help, things can improve. </p>
</level1><level1><h1>    Understanding Mental Illness
</h1><p>Mental illnesses (also called mental disorders or psychiatric disorders) are biologically-based brain disorders.  They cannot be overcome through "willpower" and are not related to a person's "character" or intelligence.  They are illnesses just like heart disease or diabetes.</p>
<p>Mental disorders can profoundly disrupt a person's thinking, feelings, perceptions, moods, ability to relate to others, and capacity for coping with the demands of life.</p>
<level2><h2>  Major Mental Illnesses
</h2><p>Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and generalized anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses.</p>
<p>Mental disorders fall along a continuum of severity from mild to moderate to severe.  The most serious and disabling conditions affect about 5% of adults and children in the United States but more than 25% of people experience a mental illness at some time in their lives. </p>
<p>Mental illnesses tend to strike individuals in the prime of their lives, often during adolescence and young adulthood.  All ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable.</p>
<p>Mental illnesses are treatable. </p>
<p>Most people with serious mental illness need medication to help control symptoms, but also rely on supportive counseling, self-help groups, assistance with housing, vocational rehabilitation, income assistance, and other community services to achieve their highest level of recovery. </p>
<p>Without treatment, the consequences of mental illness for the individual, the family, and society are staggering: unnecessary disability, unemployment, substance abuse/addiction, homelessness, inappropriate incarceration, suicide, and wasted lives.  The economic cost of untreated mental illness is more than $100 billion a year. </p>
<p>Treatment for serious mental illness today can be highly effective.  Between 70-90% of persons treated have significant reduction in symptoms and improvement in the quality of life. </p>
<p>Early identification and treatment is of vital importance.  By getting people the treatment they need early, recovery is accelerated and the brain is protected from further harm.</p>
<p>What are Co-occurring Disorders? </p>
<p>A person who has a mental disorder AND a substance dependence (addiction) disorder is said to have co-occurring disorder.  Although they are separate conditions, they can interact in many ways and complicate the diagnosis and treatment of each.</p>
<p>Addiction can directly contribute to the onset of mental disorders or cause existing ones to worsen.</p>
<p>Addiction can sometimes mask a mental illness.  Some mental illnesses may make a person more vulnerable to using substances and hence to developing an addiction.</p>
<p>Addiction can interfere with recovery from mental illness; likewise untreated mental illness can interfere with recovery from addiction.  Relapse in one disorder can lead to relapse in the other.</p>
<p>It is important that healthcare providers understand the treatment needs of both disorders so the most effective treatment can be provided.  Integrated treatment that focuses on both psychiatric and addiction issues is recommended.For the Family:  What to do when someone you love is mentally ill</p>
<p><q><em>“I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.”   Henry David Thoreau</em></q></p>
</level2><level2><h2>  Destigmatize the illness—Understand these basics:
</h2><p>Mental illnesses are physical disorders of the brain that result in disturbed brain functioning, thinking and behavior.</p>
<p>The person who is ill is not to blame, is not bad, is not someone to be ashamed of, is not weak and is not a failure.</p>
<p>The family of a person who is mentally ill is not at fault, did not cause it, could not have prevented it, has not failed, and does not need to feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Respond to this illness as you would for any other disease.</p>
</level2><level2><h2>  Educate yourself about Mental Illness
</h2><p>Ask healthcare providers for information.</p>
<p>Access websites for current mental health information.</p>
<p>Go to libraries and bookstores.</p>
<p>Attend your local NAMI support meeting and ask for information.  NAMI (The National Alliance on Mental Illness) is dedicated to dispelling the stigma and misconceptions of mental illness through support, education, training, and advocacy.  Access the national NAMI website at <a href="http://www.nami.org/" external="true">www.nami.org</a> or call 1-800-950-6264. For information in Montana call 1-406-443-7871 or go to <a href="http://www.namimt.org/" external="true" /> <a href="http://www.namimt.org/" external="true">www.namimt.org</a>.</p>
<p>Attend a NAMI Family-to-Family educational program.  This is a 12-week course that provides current and detailed information about the major mental illnesses and how to best cope with them.</p>
<p>You will find there are numerous resources with current information.  What is known is changing rapidly and the medications available to treat mental illnesses are becoming increasingly effective.  Stay as up-to-date as possible!</p>
</level2><level2><h2>  Don’t go it alone – get support for yourself
</h2><p>The stigma and shame about mental illness that is still so prevalent in our society often keeps us isolated and alone in trying to cope with the illness of our loved one.  It is helpful to reach out to others who know what we are going through and can understand our feelings and concerns. </p>
<p>Consider counseling for yourself with a trained professional.</p>
<p>Ask your local mental health program/care provider or hospital about their family support services or other groups such as NAMI.</p>
</level2><level2><h2>  Get involved in your loved one’s healthcare
</h2><p>Because of the disordered and dysfunctional thinking that is part of mental illness, it is especially important that we be involved in our loved one's care and treatment.  Our loved one is not always able to communicate clearly or report accurately about what is going on.  We need to be his/her advocate and voice when that is necessary. </p>
<p>Encourage your loved one to sign a release of information so that you can communicate and consult with his/her health care providers when necessary.  If consent is not given, you can always provide written communication to these providers about your observations. </p>
<p>Become familiar with the medications your loved one is taking so you can report on their level of effectiveness and side effects.</p>
<p>Help your loved one keep current and accurate written records including dates and kinds of symptoms experienced, medications taken, and names of current or past health care providers.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to be assertive if you feel a health care provider is not adequately attending to your loved one's health care needs.Treatment Services </p>

</h1><p><q>“Recovery is being fully engaged in life regardless of what you’re living with.” - Dr. Ken Duckworth, Medical Director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)</q></p>
<level2><h2>  The Path to Recovery is a Process and Requires Time 
</h2><p> Whether we are the ones suffering from mental illness or have a loved one with a mental illness, most people experience a similar progression of challenges.</p>
<list type="ul"><li><p><strong>Dealing With the Catastrophic Event</strong></p>
</li></list><p>Coping with mental illness is a process of grieving the loss of potential and dreams that were present before the onset of the illness.  An initial reaction of shock and denial is usually experienced by the one suffering from a mental illness as well as the family members.  We may find ourselves thinking, “This is not what I think it is.”</p>
<list type="ul"><li><p><strong>Learning to Cope</strong></p>
</li></list><p>Expect strong emotions of fear, anger, guilt, resentment, despair and anguish.  Rather than “stuffing” these emotions or acting out in ways that would be harmful to yourself or others, learn to cope and work through these emotions by practicing the self care suggestions listed in this pamphlet and getting help from a mental health professional.</p>
<list type="ul"><li><p><strong>Moving Into Recovery</strong></p>
</li></list><p>Gradually, recognition, understanding, and acceptance emerge as we embrace the reality of our illness or the illness of our loved one, and choose to live again. When hope is rekindled, a willingness to try emerges and a new and valued sense of self and purpose is the result. </p>
</level2><level2><h2>   Self Care Can Help Us Move Closer to Recovery
</h2><p>Practicing good self care habits improves our ability to cope as we work through our difficult challenges.  </p>
<list type="ul"><li><p><strong>Act upon Areas You May Have Neglected</strong></p>
</li></list><p>Implement a change in a physical area of your life.  Obvious basic needs such as, sleeping well, eating nutritious food and exercise are easy to neglect while going through a tough time. </p>
<list type="ul"><li><p>Stay connected <em>socially</em> to friends.  Some suggestions might be to plan an outing such as going on a walk with someone, or going out to dinner, to a movie, concert, or other enjoyable event.  Perhaps play games and allow yourself to laugh out loud.  Join a support group such as NAMI Family to Family or Peer to Peer.  Do an act of kindness for someone else.</p>
</li><li><p>Express <em>emotions</em> to a trusted friend, counselor, support group, or in a journal or letter.  <q>“People must be given the opportunity to hurt out loud.” – Lady Bird Johnson</q></p>
</li><li><p>Set aside time for your <strong>spiritual</strong> longings.  Some quiet times may include listening to soothing and / or worshipful music, praying, meditating, or reading inspirational material.  Look for and think about intangible tokens of grace through what you observe in creation and in what you hear or receive from strangers and other supportive people in your life.</p>
</li><li><p>Keep <em>mentally </em>active.  Pursue knowledge of your or your loved one’s mental illness (see suggestions made in the Family Section of this pamphlet).  Have a good book on hand.  Work on a puzzle or play a board game that requires some concentration.</p>

</li></list><blockquote ><p><q>The concept of ‘choosing to live again’ is as meaningful for family members as it is for consumers.  It asks us to give up unrealistic expectations, and put away our shattered dreams of what might have been.  It tells us to surrender the fiction that we can hide mental illness through denial and silence.  It demands that we replace loss and grief with action; it insists that we embrace the people we love the way they are now and work to give them brighter hope for the future.”   Patricia E. Deegan, Ph.D. – Clinical Psychologist and consumer</q></p>

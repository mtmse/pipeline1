						<line>April is the cruellest month, breeding</line>

						<line>Memory and desire, stirring</line>

						<line>Winter kept us warm, covering</line>
						<line>Earth in forgetful snow, feeding</line>
						<line>A little life with dried tubers.</line>
						<line>Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee</line>
						<line>With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,</line>
						<line>And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,<linenum>10</linenum>

				<h1>NOTES ON "THE WASTE LAND"</h1>
				<p>Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston's book on the Grail legend: From Ritual to Romance</p>
				<p>Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston's book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble.  To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean The Golden Bough; I have used especially the two volumes Adonis, Attis, Osiris.  Anyone who is acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies.</p>

						<p>46.  I am not familiar with the exact constitution of the Tarot pack of cards, from which I have obviously departed to suit my own convenience.  The Hanged Man, a member of the traditional pack, fits my purpose in two ways:  because he is associated in my mind with the Hanged God of Frazer, and because I associate him with the hooded figure in the passage of the disciples to Emmaus in Part V. The Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant appear later; also the "crowds of people," and Death by Water is executed in Part IV.  The Man with Three Staves (an authentic member of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite arbitrarily, with the Fisher King himself.</p>

						<p>218.  Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a "character," is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest.  Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias.  What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem.  The whole passage from Ovid is of great anthropological interest:</p>

Chapman says (Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America) "it is most at home in secluded woodland and thickety retreats. . . . Its notes are not remarkable for variety or volume, but in purity and sweetness of tone and exquisite modulation they are unequalled."  Its "water-dripping song" is justly celebrated.</p>

  File signature detector a.k.a Linux Magic.
  <p>Detect the type of a resource based on magic numbers (byte signature) or XML tokens (XML signature).</p>
  <p>The signature data (signature library) is stored in an XML document (see SignatureLibrary.rng); 
  this package ships with a default exemplar of such a library.</p>
  
  <p>Usage example:</p>
  <pre><code>
  //create instance, optionally load the default library
  SignatureDetector detector = new SignatureDetector(true);
  //load a user library
  detector.loadLibrary(myLibrary.toURL);
  //detect a resource
  List&lt;Signature&gt; list = detector.detect(myResourceURL);
  </code></pre>
  
  <p>The return type is a List of <code>Signature</code> objects. This is because many times, a resource will match several signatures. For example (and depending on which libraries are loaded), a Daisy 2.02 
  NCC file could match an 2.02 NCC signature and a XHTML 1.0 signature. The list is sorted with closest match first.</p>
  
  <p>Documentation on how to compose a signature library (or extending the shipped one) is available in
  ./SignatureLibrary.rng</p>
